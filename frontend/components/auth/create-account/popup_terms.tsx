You will always be able to view the most current version of these Terms by clicking on the Terms of Use link at the bottom of any page of a ORAKLE Network property. Note that these Terms do not apply to our properties and services that display a link to different terms of use. In the event that we expand the ORAKLE Network through our acquisition of another company and/or its properties, that company may operate its properties subject to its own terms of use accessible via a link on such properties until we integrate its practices with ours, at which point a link to these Terms will be displayed on its properties. By using the Services, you agree to these Terms, whether or not you are a registered member of the ORAKLE Network. These Terms govern your use of the Services and create a binding legal agreement that we may enforce against you in the event of a violation. If you do not agree to all of these Terms of Use, do not use the Services!</p>
        <br></br>
        <p><b>Account Registration</b></p>

You agree that your Registration Information is true, accurate, current, and complete, and you will promptly update your Registration Information as necessary so that it continues to be true, accurate, current and complete. We may attempt to verify the accuracy of the Registration Information that you have provided and update it as necessary. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Orakle account username and password and you may not permit another person to use your username and password to access the Services. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. If you believe that the security of your account information has been compromised, you should immediately change your username and password through the account settings feature or notify us and we will assist you.
